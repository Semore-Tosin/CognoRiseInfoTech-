Cognorise InfoTech Data Analysis Internship
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Analysis internship at Cognorise InfoTech. The internship involved three tasks focusing on different aspects of data analysis using Python, SQL, and PowerPoint.

Contents

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Unemployment in India
File: EDA UNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA.ipynb
Description: This Jupyter Notebook contains an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the unemployment trends across various regions of India. The analysis focuses on understanding the unemployment rate, labour participation rate, and employment estimates using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Key Insights:
Identification of regional disparities in unemployment rates.
Comparison of urban and rural unemployment trends.
Analysis of labour participation rates over time.

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis of Red Wine Quality
File: EDA of REDWINE QUALITY.ipynb
Description: This Jupyter Notebook presents an EDA on the quality of red wine. The analysis investigates the relationships between different chemical properties (such as acidity, alcohol content, and density) and the overall quality of the wine, using visualization techniques.
Key Insights:
Correlations between chemical properties and wine quality.
Identification of key factors that most strongly influence wine quality.
Visualization of data distribution and relationships.

Task 3: Employee Salary Analysis (SQL)

File: Employee Salary Analysis.pptx
Description: This PowerPoint presentation presents an analysis of employee salaries across various data science roles. The analysis was conducted using SQL to query a dataset and understand how factors such as experience level, job title, company size, and geographic location influence salary distribution. The presentation includes SQL queries and their corresponding results side by side.
Key Insights:
Salary distribution across different experience levels and job titles.
The impact of company size and location on employee compensation.
Insights into the role of remote work on salary variations.

How to Use
Jupyter Notebooks: Open the .ipynb files in a Jupyter Notebook environment to explore the code and results interactively.
PowerPoint Presentation: Open the .pptx file in PowerPoint to view the analysis, including SQL queries and their results.
